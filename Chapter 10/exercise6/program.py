# Write a class named Patient that has attributes for the following data:
#  • First name, middle name, and last name
#  • Address, city, state, and ZIP code
#  • Phone number
#  • Name and phone number of emergency contact
# The Patient class’s _ _ init _ _ method should accept an argument for each
# attribute. The Patient class should also have accessor and mutator methods for
# each attribute.
# Next, write a class named Procedure that represents a medical procedure that
# has been performed on a patient. The Procedure class should have attributes for the following data:
#  • Name of the procedure
#  • Date of the procedure
#  • Name of the practitioner who performed the procedure
#  • Charges for the procedure
# The Procedure class’s _ _ init _ _ method should accept an argument for each
# attribute. The Procedure class should also have accessor and mutator methods for
# each attribute. Next, write a program that creates an instance of the Patient
# class, initialized with sample data. Then, create three instances of the
# Procedure class, initialized with the following data:

# The program should display the patient’s information, information about all
# three of the procedures, and the total charges of the three procedures.
